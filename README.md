Janes Asmussen Szarmach

- I followed the [app engine tutorial](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/java/gettingstarted/introduction) and checked in the [app-engine-tutorial](app-engine-tutorial/), the resulting module of following that tutorial step by step. The app is [in production here](https://krico-test.appspot.com).
- I followed the [cloud endpoints tutorial](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/java/endpoints/getstarted/backend/) and checked in the [cloud-endpoints-tutorial](cloud-endpoints-tutorial/), the resulting module of following that tutorial step by step.

The idea is that we can track the evolution of that app later.

For each of "task" a branch was created and then merged (via pull request), and I mentioned the issues #1, #2, #3, #4, etc on the commits to see if it would link things...

For now this readme is a log of what's happening for:
 - Paul Janes
 - Christian Asmussen
 - Waldemar Szarmach
