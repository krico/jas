## Development

Before your first commit, read this :-)

### Ground rules

 - Most of what you change should go as a bullet into [latest changes](CHANGELOG.md).  It is like a stack,
 so your changes should go on top, but in the proper *category* (bugfix, changes, features, ...)
 - Use the [sandbox-appengine](../../sandbox/sandbox-appengine/) to experiment with new technologies (frameworks, etc),
 only add them here if you are sure about it.

### Bower

 - The project uses [Bower](http://bower.io) to manage *web components*.  Components are installed to `src/main/webapp/bc`
