# Jasify Schedule - App Engine

*The Jasify Schedule frontend.*

## Development

Before your first commit, read this :-)

### Ground rules

 - Most of what you change should go as a bullet into [latest changes](CHANGELOG.md).  It is like a stack,
 so your changes should go on top, but in the proper *category* (bugfix, changes, features, ...)
